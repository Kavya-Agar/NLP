# NLP, Deep Learning, ML & AI Learning Repository

Welcome to my personal repository for learning and experimenting with:

- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Deep Learning
- Machine Learning (ML)
- Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Hugging Face ecosystem
- Data Science concepts

## About

This repo contains my Jupyter notebooks, code samples, and notes as I explore various topics in data science and machine learning. Each notebook focuses on a specific concept, library, or technique.

## Topics Covered

- NLP fundamentals and applications
- Deep learning architectures (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, etc.)
- ML algorithms and workflows
- Using Hugging Face for NLP and LLMs
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Model training, evaluation, and deployment
- AI research and practical projects

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Kavya-Agar/NLP.git
    ```
2. Install required dependencies (see individual notebook requirements).
3. Explore the notebooks and experiment with the code.
